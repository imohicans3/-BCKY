# This is a joke project

This project started because of [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b6mudk/bcky_update_wsb_was_right_diversification_bad/) by [u/motorboatbwbwb](https://www.reddit.com/user/motorboatbwbwb), which is an updated version of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b6hvdf/i_indexed_beckys_portfolio_so_you_dont_have_to/), which is preceded by [this post from r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9n31xf/introducing_the_white_girl_index/), which refers to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9mvabs/bill_ackman_reveals_900_million_bet_on_starbucks/e7htx2q) about [this news article](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/bill-ackmans-pershing-reveals-stake-in-starbucks.html).
